# Multimedia README presentation

This presentation has two views. The root README is normal GitHub Markdown with
an SVG banner and six real GIF previews. The adjacent README-MULTIMEDIA.html is a
script-free local document with the full responsive panel layout, theme-aware
backgrounds, a still-image control and links to the public documentation.
Open it from the checkout in a browser. GitHub's file viewer does not host it as
a web page; no Pages deployment or new public service is configured.

## Preservation and source

The presentation belongs to the v0.5.0 source. The exact prior README is
retained as [README-HISTORY-PRE-MULTIMEDIA.md](../README-HISTORY-PRE-MULTIMEDIA.md).
The already existing pre-visual history also remains untouched. The new README
keeps its technical content below the presentation unchanged, including the
quick-start checkout of the v0.5.0 tag.

The original GIF files, PNG alternatives, transcripts, fixtures and
[media manifest](../media/gifs/MANIFEST.txt) are not regenerated or relabelled.
Each preview retains its recorded source. Three cards over 12 seconds are edited
log replays, not the CLI's elapsed execution time. No generated mock terminal,
unmeasured speed figure, static CI-passing badge or source-truth claim is added.

## Accessibility and scope

The page uses system fonts, local images, no JavaScript, no tracking and no remote
font requests. Its picture sources prefer PNGs when reduced motion is requested.
The standalone still-image control hides moving previews; it does not claim to
stop GIF decoding. Images have alt text, transcript links and full-size alternatives.
On narrow screens the HTML card grid becomes one column. GitHub controls the
surrounding Markdown page's appearance; only its image assets can carry this design.

The original [static gallery](../media/gifs/STATIC.md) remains available. Opening
external documentation links needs a network; opening the local presentation does not.

## Regeneration and checks

The Rust-only presentation builder is tools/readme_presentation.rs. It refuses
unexpected input headings and pre-existing output paths, verifies the original
media pins before and after its edits, archives the actual preceding README and
adds only three exact presentation-asset pins. It does not allow arbitrary SVG or
HTML files. The source manifest is then refreshed and the complete tree must
pass xtask verify. Normal three-platform CI is read separately for the final head.

The presentation was built once with Rust 1.85.0 and committed by its author;
no workflow writes to the repository. The read-only `readme-presentation`
workflow compiles and tests the builder and reruns it on every change to the
presentation or its sources. On an existing presentation the builder only
validates: any generated file that differs from the committed one fails the
check, and historic recordings are never replaced. Visual and CI results are
recorded in the pull request; this guide does not predeclare PASS.

## Review criteria

Check the rendered page at desktop and phone widths, both color schemes, all six
previews, the keyboard-accessible still control and reduced-motion image selection.
Confirm no clipped text, horizontal page overflow, remote image/font requests or
script execution; validate all local links and every preserved media hash.
A local browser rendering is not an independent check of GitHub's rendered page.

The license, CLA, historical permissions and third-party notices are unchanged.
[LICENSE](../LICENSE) and [media rights](../media/RIGHTS.md) remain authoritative.
